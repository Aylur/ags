# Aylur's Gtk Shell

This is a library built for [GJS](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs) to allow defining GTK widgets in a declarative way. It also provides services and other utilities to interact with the system so that these widgets can have functionality.
GJS is a JavaScript runtime built on Firefox's SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine and the GNOME platform libraries, the same runtime [GNOME Shell](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell) runs on. 

It was heavily inspired by [EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww).

Currently, only Wayland is supported, but it also works on X11, [see #19](https://github.com/Aylur/ags/issues/19).
