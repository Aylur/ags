/**
 * A `PangoLayout` structure represents an entire paragraph of text.
 * 
 * While complete access to the layout capabilities of Pango is provided
 * using the detailed interfaces for itemization and shaping, using
 * that functionality directly involves writing a fairly large amount
 * of code. `PangoLayout` provides a high-level driver for formatting
 * entire paragraphs of text at once. This includes paragraph-level
 * functionality such as line breaking, justification, alignment and
 * ellipsization.
 * 
 * A `PangoLayout` is initialized with a `PangoContext`, UTF-8 string
 * and set of attributes for that string. Once that is done, the set of
 * formatted lines can be extracted from the object, the layout can be
 * rendered, and conversion between logical character positions within
 * the layout's text, and the physical position of the resulting glyphs
 * can be made.
 * 
 * There are a number of parameters to adjust the formatting of a
 * `PangoLayout`. The following image shows adjustable parameters
 * (on the left) and font metrics (on the right):
 * 
 * <picture>
 *   <source srcset="layout-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
 *   <img alt="Pango Layout Parameters" src="layout-light.png">
 * </picture>
 * 
 * The following images demonstrate the effect of alignment and
 * justification on the layout of text:
 * 
 * | | |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | ![align=left](align-left.png) | ![align=left, justify](align-left-justify.png) |
 * | ![align=center](align-center.png) | ![align=center, justify](align-center-justify.png) |
 * | ![align=right](align-right.png) | ![align=right, justify](align-right-justify.png) |
 * 
 * 
 * It is possible, as well, to ignore the 2-D setup,
 * and simply treat the results of a `PangoLayout` as a list of lines.

/**
 * A `PangoGlyphItemIter` is an iterator over the clusters in a
 * `PangoGlyphItem`.
 * 
 * The *forward direction* of the iterator is the logical direction of text.
 * That is, with increasing `start_index` and `start_char` values. If `glyph_item`
 * is right-to-left (that is, if `glyph_item->item->analysis.level` is odd),
 * then `start_glyph` decreases as the iterator moves forward.  Moreover,
 * in right-to-left cases, `start_glyph` is greater than `end_glyph`.
 * 
 * An iterator should be initialized using either
 * pango_glyph_item_iter_init_start() or
 * pango_glyph_item_iter_init_end(), for forward and backward iteration
 * respectively, and walked over using any desired mixture of
 * pango_glyph_item_iter_next_cluster() and
 * pango_glyph_item_iter_prev_cluster().
 * 
 * A common idiom for doing a forward iteration over the clusters is:
 * 
 * ```
 * PangoGlyphItemIter cluster_iter;
 * gboolean have_cluster;
 * 
 * for (have_cluster = pango_glyph_item_iter_init_start (&cluster_iter,
 *                                                       glyph_item, text);
 *      have_cluster;
 *      have_cluster = pango_glyph_item_iter_next_cluster (&cluster_iter))
 * {
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * Note that `text` is the start of the text for layout, which is then
 * indexed by `glyph_item->item->offset` to get to the text of `glyph_item`.
 * The `start_index` and `end_index` values can directly index into `text`. The
 * `start_glyph,` `end_glyph,` `start_char,` and `end_char` values however are
 * zero-based for the `glyph_item`.  For each cluster, the item pointed at by
 * the start variables is included in the cluster while the one pointed at by
 * end variables is not.
 * 
 * None of the members of a `PangoGlyphItemIter` should be modified manually.
